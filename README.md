1. Drive Adaptability and Market Responsiveness
In most industries, owing to strict regulations regarding labeling and packaging, businesses need to manage the numerous changes driven by regulatory or brand needs.

With a robust artwork management solution, companies can

Reduce the risk of recalls: The solution provides workflows for maximum efficiency, reduces the number of iterations, ensures regulatory compliance, and maintains brand consistency across all products and markets to reduce the risk of recalls.

2. Accelerate Production to Leverage Market Opportunities 
In industries with intense competition, any delay in launching the product, even by a day, can lead to significant losses. 

A CPG company, for example, might want to launch a new shampoo size. Or a pharma company might need to change the pack inserts or medication guides. Manual and traditional management of all packaging artwork dependencies are long-drawn and effort-intensive. These also impact the time to get the product to the consumer as significant time is spent managing multiple SKUs.

With a packaging artwork management system,

It is possible to effectively manage all artwork dependencies, generate alerts for changes in SKUs, and provide clear workflows that include regulatory submissions, artwork approvals, print & packaging specifications, etc.
Set automatic audit logs, task assignments, alerts and reminders, real-time status, and more.
Reduce approval time and packaging write-offs. 
Accommodate product line extensions, market extensions, promos, regulatory adjustments, barcode changes, etc. swiftly.
Artwork management systems deliver quick output about product labels, design, and artwork and allow businesses to move from artwork approvals to printing with confidence and agility. Businesses can then leverage market capitalization opportunities and drive robust marketing activities based on seasonal and evolving market trends.

The capacity to respond to customer demands and get products to market faster creates more revenue opportunities for businesses.

3. Ensure Faster Product Launches Drive a Revenue Impact
A packaging artwork management solution provides access controls, audit trails, and digital rights management to protect valuable intellectual property and prevent counterfeiting.  

Let’s take an example of a consumer-packaged goods company that wants to introduce combo bundles during a festive season.  Design teams and marketing departments can leverage the power of artwork management solutions and save time and resources by utilizing streamlined workflows, version control, and digital asset management. This can enable the company to get the combo to the market faster and generate more revenue by giving the product more shelf days.

Artwork management systems have a direct impact on revenue as they combine artwork management, digital proofing, and collaboration features for faster artwork delivery.


4. Faster Pre-market Approvals
The pharma landscape has become intensely competitive. Amongst all the other regulatory demands, pharma products need pre-market approvals for their artwork. This requires companies to ensure information accuracy, consistency, and compliance when they send their work to the regulatory body. 

Delays in getting artwork approvals for product bundles, new brand designs, evolving SKUs, etc. have a negative impact on the product release date. To ensure timely approvals and product launches, businesses have to ensure packaging artwork efficiencies, map artwork elements to the packaging structure, and ensure accuracy and consistency in the final product packaging.

With a full-fledged artwork management solution, businesses can navigate the challenges of increasing SKU varieties, size, and shape variations, and launch product variations without any delay. Instead of wasting time on costly reworks and consequently losing revenues, a packaging artwork management solution ensures that the products go to market at lightning speed and get more shelf life.


5. Get it First-time-right 

Getting packaging artwork right the first time around can open up revenue streams. Whether it is a seasonal special, a limited-edition product, combo offers, or a brand-wide design shift, it is qq2important for businesses to avoid time-consuming, effort-intensive manual adjustments in packaging artwork. 

Packaging & labeling is a mission-critical process that constitutes a significant part of the product development process. Accelerating this part allows businesses to accelerate artwork management by almost 50-70%. 

An AI-powered artwork management system allows faster adaptation to market trends and fosters creativity while ensuring that the artwork is right in the first go. It facilitates faster market entry and helps in building a strong brand image. The integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence artwork management software creates avenues for innovative and interactive packaging designs, further enhancing brand visibility and influencing consumer engagement.
